# Summary
A Digital twin is...
Takes data [@dt-stormwater] from external sources and computes flood map...

Select area and give parameters...
Identify flood level at different times during the flood event...
Identify buildings flooded past a certain threshold...
3D Visualisation front-end...
API...
Kaiapoi, New Zealand...

# Statement of need
New Zealand communities are at risk of flood inundation...

Analysing flood inundation risk and effects is hard...
Automating analysis...

Small communities are affected by flooding and have less support for analysis compared to cities...
Small teams repeating their own work can instead build on the analysis our tool does...



We share an open-source system for a digital twin for flood analysis...

How we have helped flood resilience...

# Further work?...
Feedback wanted...
Extensive testing of areas outside main case study area...
Environmental pollution digital twin...
Save and reload scenarios UI...
